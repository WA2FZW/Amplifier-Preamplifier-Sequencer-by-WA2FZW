Amplifier/Preamplifier/SDR Switch Sequencer Version 1.5

By: John Price â€“ WA2FZW - December 15, 2022

This is a software controlled sequencer designed to be able
to control a low-noise mast-mounted preamplifier, a linear
amplifier and an SDR switching device.

The timing of the sequencing is controlled by the software
in an Arduino Nano.

Version 1.5 is designed specifically for use with my Icom
IC-9700 and can control 2 linear amplifiers, 2 low-noise
preamplifiers and 2 SDR switching devices on any two of
the three bands that radio can operate on. Version 1.5 no
longer has the transmit inhibit capability for my FT-891
that was included in earlier versions of the hardware and
software.

The documentation, software and Gerber files to make the
version 1.4 PCBs are still available here.
