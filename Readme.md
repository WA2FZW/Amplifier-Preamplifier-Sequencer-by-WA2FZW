Amplifier/Preamplifier/SDR Switch Sequencer Version 2.0
By: John Price â€“ WA2FZW - March 30, 2025

This is a software controlled sequencer designed to be able
to control two low-noise mast-mounted preamplifiers, linear
amplifiers and SDR switching devices when used with the
Icom IC-9700 on any two of the three bands that radio can
operate on.

The timing of the sequencing is controlled by the software
in an Arduino Nano.

Version 2.0 is an improvement over previous versions in
that the sequencing can be initiated via a DTR or RTS
signal from an optional USB to TTL interface. The
sequencing can also be initiated via an optional footswitch.
This has the advantage of being able to put the radio
into transmit mode after the preamps and amplifiers have
been switched.

The documentation, software and Gerber files to make the
version 1.4 PCBs are still available here. That version
is designed for use with my Yaesu FT-891.
