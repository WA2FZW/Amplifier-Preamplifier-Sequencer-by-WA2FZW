Amplifier/Preamplifier/SDR Switch Sequencer Version 1.4

By: John Price â€“ WA2FZW - November 24, 2022

This is a software controlled sequencer designed to be able
to control a low-noise mast-mounted preamplifier, a linear
amplifier and an SDR switching device.

The timing of the sequencing is controlled by the software
in an Arduino Nano.

I designed it to specifically work with both my Yaesu
FT-891 and Icom IC-9700 radios, but it will work with
any radio that provides a ground indication when the
PTT is active. Of course the code could be modified to
operate differently.
