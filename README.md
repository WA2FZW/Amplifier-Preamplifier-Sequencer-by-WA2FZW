This device can be used to switch an antenna mounted low-noise
preamplifier and a linear amplifier from receive mode to transmit
mode (and vice-versa) before actually sending power to the antenna.

It was designed specifically for use with my Yaesu FT-891, a
Heathkit SB-200 (converted to 6 meters) and a Mini-Kits EME220-6M
preamplifier. It should work as-is with any Yaesu radio having
the same TUN/LIN connector arrangement as the FT-891, and pretty
much any amplifier and LNA.

It depends on the Yaesu's capability to prevent the transmitter
from producing power under control of a transmit inhibit input,
however, at least for digital modes using WSJT-X, there is a
workaround for radios that don't have the inhibit capability. The
workaround is described in the documentation.
